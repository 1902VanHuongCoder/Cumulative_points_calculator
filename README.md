* Some description of the project
  This website project aims to provide a seamless platform for university students to calculate their cumulative points.

  Leveraging the power of ReactJS and Tailwind CSS for the front-end, it promises a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface that enhances user experience.

  The utilization of Firebase for the back-end ensures efficient data management, real-time updates, and secure authentication, allowing students to access and manage their cumulative points with ease and trust.
 
  With ReactJS driving the front-end, users can expect interactive components and smooth navigation, while Tailwind CSS facilitates a sleek and customizable design.
  The use of Firebase for the back-end enables seamless integration of user authentication, data storage, and retrieval, guaranteeing a robust and reliable foundation for the website's operations.
